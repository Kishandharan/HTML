# HTML
HTML, an acro of Hyper text markup languange, is a language created to make websites!    
It is very widely used and is nowadays common to see websites built with HTML.    
Now to be precise, HTML alone is not enough to create webpages!    
We will need two more languages to build a complete webpage.    
That is, CSS and JavaScript!    

Think of HTML as a skeleton of a house, you write the base content of a webpage in HTML.    
Now CSS, an acro os Cascading Style Sheet, is like a styling of a house with so many colors.    
With CSS you can style your webpage to make it look like however you want.    
With JavaScript, you decide the functionality of your webpage!    
If you are willing to make a website that is static and does not change dynamically, HTML and CSS alone is enough.    
But, if you want to make functional webpages such as Games or Calendar, you will need JavaScript too.    

## Tags
Let us take a look at a sample HTML code with no CSS or JavaScript involved:     
```
<!DOCTYPE html>    
<html lang="en">    
    <head>    
        <meta charset="UTF-8">    
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">    
        <title>My website</title>    
    </head>    
    <body>    
        <p>Hello!</p>    
    </body>    
</html>    
```    
If you are used to using XML frequently, you might find these familiar.        
See these "<>" syntaxes with text inside them? Those are called "Tags" in HTML.        
Tags are used to display different kinds of content.        
Below is the syntax of all tags in html:       
```    
<tagname attributes></tagname>    
```    
We should replace "tagname" with a real tag name and "attributes" with real attributes while coding.       
We will talk about attributes later. The first set of "<>" is called the opening tag.           
And opening tag lets HTML know that we have initiated a tag, here is where whe pass all our arguments, too.        
Now the second set of "<>" is called the closing tag. It lets HTML Know that we have ended a tag.          
Note that when using a tag, the opening and closing tag should always have the same name.            
For example, the first one on the below is wrong and the second one is correct:           
```       
<mytag1></mytag2>❌      
<mytag1></mytag1>✅         
```           
There are many tags in HTML, but here we will be talking about the following:             
- html tag
- head tag 
- body tag
- h1-h6 tag
- p tag
